PROJECT DAIN

project dain is an efficiency focused assistant with function calling,
which scales tools depending on needs.

Chat -> openai call
Simple Tasks -> Function calls
Complex tasks -> Open interpreter window, spawned and directed by the agent.

Why not just use open interpreter?
Open interpreter is VERY costly to run, DAIN however is more efficient, 
and calls open interpreter as a fallback when needed.

todo: 
    -gui
    -voice integration i/o
    -improved function library
    -websearch needs to open links, not just read descriptions
